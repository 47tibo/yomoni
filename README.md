## App dependencies

The app uses [gluestack ui](https://gluestack.io/) library for universal components.

## App structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
/app
   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout         # Entry point of the application
   â”œâ”€â”€ index      # Home screen

/features
   â”œâ”€â”€ home       # components and hooks for the home screen

/assets
   â”œâ”€â”€ images/          # Image assets
   â”œâ”€â”€ fonts/           # Font assets
   â”œâ”€â”€ strings           # string resources for texts in the app

/components
   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/        # gluestack ui shared components
```

## API

The API is the Rijksmuseum API. This API gives access to the Rijksmuseum catalog. The `collection` endpoint is used : 

````
https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/api/en/collection/
https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/api/en/collection/BK-17496
````

It allows to search (via query parameter) and to get the detail of an art object (the second url).
